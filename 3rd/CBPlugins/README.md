## Community Builder JEM Plugin, v 2.8

The CB Plugins have to be installed __with the CB plugin installer – not with the Joomla installer!__
 
## Translations 
The translations have to be made with CB language overrides: you add a file "override.php" into the language folder of your language in /components/com_comprofiler/plugin/language/YOURLANGUAGE

If you already use CB language overrides (means: there exists just a "override.php"), you have to insert the key words and translations manually.
Otherwise you will lose the overwrites you have just made!
