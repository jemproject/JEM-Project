<p><em>Select Category(s) by clicking the checkbox(es) at the beginning of each row.</em></p>


<p><strong>New:</strong> 
	Click the 'New' icon to create a new category.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> 
	Click the 'Edit' icon to change the selected category item. You can also do this by clicking the Category name.</p>
<p><strong>Publish:</strong> 
	Click the 'Publish' icon to publish the selected category items. Only events that are in published Categories 
	appear in the Frontend.</p>
<p><strong>Unpublish:</strong> 
	Click the 'Unpublish' icons to unpublish the selected category item. If you have unpublished a category 
	it is not any longer possible to assign an event to this one (doesn't appear in the 
	selectlist anymore). Unpublishing a category has no effect on already created events.</p>
<p><strong>Archive:</strong> 
	Click the 'Archive' icon to set the selected item(s) into 'archived' state.</p>
<p><strong>Check In:</strong> 
	Sometimes a padlock icon <img src="../images/checked_out.png" alt="padlock" /> next to a Category name shows that it is checked-out. 
	To check-in, click the name to edit. You will not be able to edit a category item if it is checked out by another user.
	<br />
	It means: If you edit an item this item is locked for other users ("Checked out" by you) to prevent conflicts when multiple writers 
	change the same things. But as long as you hadn't correct close edit view (by save or cancel) it is locked and nobody else can edit.
	Administrators have the right to overrule and unlock all items (with the risk changes get lost.)
	The administrator navigates to the menu item Tools &rarr; Global Checkin in the Menu bar. 
	It can also be checked back in by the User who has checked the item out by clicking the 'Edit' icon of 
	the Content item and then clicking either the 'Save' or 'Cancel' icon, or by using the Check In funtion in the toolbar 
	on the top right of the screen.</p>
<p><strong>Trash:</strong> 
	Click the 'Trash' icon to permanently delete the selected category Items.</p>
<p><strong>Rebuild:</strong> 
	Click the 'Rebuild' icon to rebuild the hierarchical structure of the categories. 
	If you think there is something wrong with the structure of categories (e.g. after an import), then use this button.
	Using it does not delete any data. At the end of the rebuild process you should see an info message with 
	the following text: 	"Categories tree data successfully rebuilt."</p>
<p><strong>Help:</strong> 
	Click the Help icon to access a relevant Help Screen.</p>
