<h1>List Categories</h1>

<h3>Description</h3>

<div>
    <p><img src="../../../../../media/com_jem/images/icon-48-categories.png" alt="" class="left" />
        Manage your category items from this screen. Here you may view a listing of all categories.
        You can delete, edit or add categories using this screen. Also you can publish or unpublish categories.</p>
    <div class="clear"></div>
</div>


<h3>Navigation</h3>

<p>To access this screen use:
    <strong>Components</strong> &rarr; <strong>JEM</strong> &rarr; <strong>Categories</strong></p>

<h3>Toolbar</h3>

<p><em>Select Category(s) by clicking the checkbox(es) at the beginning of each row.</em></p>

<p><strong>New:</strong>
    Click the 'New' icon to create a new category.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong>
    Click the 'Edit' icon to change the selected category item. You can also do this by clicking the Category name.</p>
<p><strong>Publish:</strong>
    Click the 'Publish' icon to publish the selected category items. Only events that are in published Categories
    appear in the Frontend.</p>
<p><strong>Unpublish:</strong>
    Click the 'Unpublish' icons to unpublish the selected category item. If you have unpublished a category
    it is not any longer possible to assign an event to this one (doesn't appear in the
    selectlist anymore). Unpublishing a category has no effect on already created events.</p>
<p><strong>Archive:</strong>
    Click the 'Archive' icon to set the selected item(s) into 'archived' state.</p>
<p><strong>Check In:</strong>
    Sometimes a padlock icon <img src="../images/checked_out.png" alt="padlock" /> next to a Category name shows that it is checked-out.
    To check-in, click the name to edit. You will not be able to edit a category item if it is checked out by another user.
    <br />
    It means: If you edit an item this item is locked for other users ("Checked out" by you) to prevent conflicts when multiple writers
    change the same things. But as long as you hadn't correct close edit view (by save or cancel) it is locked and nobody else can edit.
    Administrators have the right to overrule and unlock all items (with the risk changes get lost.)
    The administrator navigates to the menu item Tools &rarr; Global Checkin in the Menu bar.
    It can also be checked back in by the User who has checked the item out by clicking the 'Edit' icon of
    the Content item and then clicking either the 'Save' or 'Cancel' icon, or by using the Check In funtion in the toolbar
    on the top right of the screen.</p>
<p><strong>Trash:</strong>
    Click the 'Trash' icon to permanently delete the selected category Items.</p>
<p><strong>Rebuild:</strong>
    Click the 'Rebuild' icon to rebuild the hierarchical structure of the categories.
    If you think there is something wrong with the structure of categories (e.g. after an import), then use this button.
    Using it does not delete any data. At the end of the rebuild process you should see an info message with
    the following text:     "Categories tree data successfully rebuilt."</p>
