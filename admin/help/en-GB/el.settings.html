<h2>Basic Settings:<a name="basicsettings" id="basicsettings"></a></h2>

<h3>Display - Settings</h3>

<p><strong>Show Link to detail page:</strong><br />
Select if you wish to link to the detail page through icons or the
title of the event. Link on title only works if showtitle is yes,
icons only if you had set the width at the layout settings.</p>

<p><strong>Format date:</strong><br />
Use here the php strftime syntax to format the date. For example
the following code '%d.%m.%Y' shows '25.05.2006'. More Information
<a href="http://www.php.net/strftime" target="_blank">php strftime
manual</a>.
Keep in mind, that not all parameters might be available on your server.
</p>

<p><strong>Format time:</strong><br />
 Use here the php strftime syntax to format the time. For example
the following code '%H.%M' shows '16.00'. More Information <a href=
"http://www.php.net/strftime" target="_blank">php strftime
manual</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Name:</strong><br />
Fill in "h" or "Uhr" for example. This will be displayed behind the
time on the frontend. Leave blank if you don't need it.</p>

<p><strong>Store IP:</strong><br />
In some countries it isn't permitted to store the IP address of your visitors. You can disable it here.</p>

<h3>Event handling</h3>

<p><strong>Handle old Events:</strong><br />
Select one of the three options. 'Delete old Events' will delete
all Events after the number of days typed in in the box below. If
you select 'Archive old Events' the Events will moved after the
typed in days in the Archive. You only have access to the archive
if you have choosen this option.<br />Note that EventList triggers this cleanup action once a 
day after midnight server time and only if an EventList view got a visit. If you want to make sure 
that the cleanup happens, create a cronjob pointing to an EventList component view.
</p>

<br />

<h3>Image handling:</h3>

<p><strong>Max. imagefilesize:</strong><br />
Type in the maximum size in kb for the imagefile.</p>

<p><strong>Max. height of thumbnailimage:</strong><br />
Type in the maximum height of the image. This value is also used on
the Frontend.</p>

<p><strong>Max. width of thumbnailimage:</strong><br />
Type in the maximum width of the image. This value is also used on
the Frontend.
</p>

<p><strong>Enable Thumbnails:</strong><br />
EventList can create thumbnails if the GD library version 2 is
installed on your server. If it isn't available this feature will be disabled.
In this case the above typed in hight and width values will be used to resize the
images if they are larger than these values. Keep in mind that this method results
in a much lower quality than using the GD library. Also the filesize of the images aren't reduced.
