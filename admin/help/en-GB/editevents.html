	If you only want to create events until a certain date, set a 'By the end of' date. See the explanation in the remark below.
</p>


<div class="box">
	<p class="attentionheader">Attention</p>
	<p class="attention">For all of the recurrence-options you can enter a 'By the end of' date. JEM will generate your
	event for the repeating interval that you have chosen, until the end date, <strong> BUT</strong> it will never create
	events that exceed the number of days ahead that you defined in the Settings &rarr; Global parameters &rarr; Advanced
	Parameters &rarr; [Generate events up to (days).
	<br />
	<br />
	This is called the 'Anticipation Window' (the number of days that JEM looks ahead) and is always leading.
	Recurring events can be auto-generated by JEM for a shorter period ahead, but never for a longer period than defined there.
	This is to protect busy websites with many event submissions by users from heavy database load.
	</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Daily:</strong>
	Choose this if you want the event to repeat every X calendar days. You can choose from 1 (every day) till 14 days.
	Then set until what date JEM should create your recurring event.</p>
<p><strong>Weekly:</strong>
	Choose this if you want the event to repeat every X weeks. You can choose from 1 (every week) till 8 weeks.
	Then set until what date JEM should create your recurring event.</p>
<p><strong>Monthly:</strong>
	Choose this if you want the event to repeat every X months. You can choose from 1 (every month) till 12 months.
	Then set until what date JEM should create your recurring event.</p>
<p><strong>Weekday:</strong>
	Choose this if you want the event to repeat every 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, etc of the month. <br />
	You can also choose the 'last' or the 'before last'. Then set until what date JEM should create your recurring event.</p>

<p>Once again, please note that the anticipation window that you set in the Settings of JEM will always be leading when
	the end date is evaluated.</p>


<h3>Metadata information</h3>

<p><strong>Metadata information:</strong>
	Enter or edit (if needed) the Meta Description and the Meta Keywords of the event here. <br />
